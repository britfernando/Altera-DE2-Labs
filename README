Altera DE2 Labs

These lab exercises were assigned as part of coursework for CSC258. Most lab exercises are very similar to the exercises designed by Altera. 

The handouts with the exercises are the files in the PDF, and the .txt/.circ files contain my work. The official Altera solutions to the lab exercises they provided are contained in the "Solutions" folder.

NOTE: .circ files were used for lab0 when designing circuits using the logisim program.
