Part1
fmax: 215.47 MHz
longest path (delay): 3.808 ns

Part2
fmax: 204.12 MHz
delay: 4.049 ns

Part3
1. To do: referencing data sheet (pg 15?), describe adder
2. fmax: 277.39 MHz
   delay: 2.710 ns
   this is much faster than the solution for part 1

Part4
1. To do: referencing data sheet (pg 15?), describe adder
2. fmax: 209.82 MHz
   delay: 3.778 ns
   this is marginally better than the solution to part 2

Part6
no fmax listed
longest path: 25.329 ns

Part7
no fmax listed
longest path: 15.842ns
logic elements: 57

Part8
when testing timing for 220 MHz, it tells me the max freq is 146.31 MHz and that 352 paths failed
To do: pipelining

Part9
